# tado API Proxy
A proxy server that bypasses tado's API rate limits by using their browser OAuth2 client for authentication. This approach provides significantly higher rate limits compared to the standard public API.

## Installation
### Docker
Create a data directory with proper permissions:
```sh
mkdir -p /path/to/data
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /path/to/data
```

Run the container:
```sh
docker run -d \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v /path/to/data:/config \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -e EMAIL=you@email.com \
  -e PASSWORD=yourpassword \
  ghcr.io/s1adem4n/tado-api-proxy:latest
```

If you encounter file permission errors, ensure the data directory is writable by user `1000:1000`.


### Binary
Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/s1adem4n/tado-api-proxy/releases).

Set your credentials and run:
```sh
export EMAIL=you@email.com
export PASSWORD=yourpassword
./tado-api-proxy
```


### From Source
Requires Go 1.25 or later.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/s1adem4n/tado-api-proxy.git
cd tado-api-proxy
export EMAIL=you@email.com
export PASSWORD=yourpassword
go run cmd/main.go
```


## Usage
Replace `https://my.tado.com` with `http://localhost:8080` in your API calls.

For example, to get your profile:
```sh
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v2/me
```

API documentation is available at `http://localhost:8080/docs`.


### Integration with Home Assistant
Currently, there is no simple way to change the API base URL in the official tado integration. However, you can edit the integration code to replace the base URL with your proxy's URL.

To do this, locate the `PyTado` package files. 
For Docker they are at `/usr/local/lib/python3.13/site-packages/PyTado/http.py`.
Change the row `MY_API = "http://my.tado.com/api/v2/"` to `MY_API = "http://localhost:8080/api/v2/"` (or your proxy URL). Restart Home Assistant and it should now use the proxy for API calls.

Another problem is that the `PyTado` library depends on the `device_code` OAuth2 flow, which is not supported by the proxy (as it automatically handles the authentication). Heavy modifications to the integration code may be required to bypass this, but users [have reported success](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/tado-rate-limiting-api-calls/928751/41) with only doing the above change.

Please see this [Home Assistant community thread](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/tado-rate-limiting-api-calls/928751) for more details.

PRs to add more info about Home Assistant integration are very welcome!


### Integration with Homebridge
The Homebridge plugin supports changing the API base URL. Just point it to your proxy instance and it should *just work*â„¢.

## Configuration
Currently, configuration is only possible via environment variables:
| Variable          | Description           | Default                                |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| LISTEN_ADDR       | Server listen address | `:8080`                                |
| TOKEN_PATH        | Token storage file    | `token.json`                           |
| COOKIES_PATH      | Cookies storage file  | `cookies.json`                         |
| EMAIL             | tado account email    | *required*                             |
| PASSWORD          | tado account password | *required*                             |
| CHROME_EXECUTABLE | Chrome/Chromium path  | `/usr/bin/chromium`                    |
| HEADLESS          | Run browser headless  | `true`                                 |
| CLIENT_ID         | OAuth2 client ID      | `af44f89e-ae86-4ebe-905f-6bf759cf6473` |


## How It Works
The proxy launches a headless Chrome instance to authenticate with tado using your credentials. It extracts the OAuth2 token from browser storage and uses it to authenticate API requests. When tokens expire, the refresh token is used to obtain new ones. After 2-3 days when refresh tokens expire, the browser authentication process repeats automatically.
